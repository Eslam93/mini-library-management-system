"""Borrow and return proposals: the Copilot prepares a change, and only the user's confirm makes it.

Preparing checks what the change itself will check, without writing a loan, and stores the
proposal: bound to the user who asked, one-time, and pending for ten minutes. It is committed
before the tool returns, so a card never points at an unsaved proposal. Preparing also deletes
the user's proposals that were resolved, or that expired, more than a week ago.

Confirming locks the proposal's row, so of two confirms at once only one finds it pending. It
marks the proposal confirmed and makes the change through the circulation service, as the user
and via the Copilot, so the status change commits with the loan. When the service refuses,
nothing it did is kept: the proposal is marked failed with the error. After a confirm, a cancel,
a failure or an expiry, a note in the proposal's conversation tells the model the outcome, so a
follow-up question gets it right.

A pending proposal past its expiry reads as expired everywhere, by the database clock, before
anything writes that status.
